## Description

CheapskateUI is a free, open-source component library that aims to be elegant-but-simple, and above all else, easily extensible.

## Development

This repo does not contain a development preview server. To preview the changes to components in this library, you will need to link the CheapskateUI repo to your current project. This can be done by navigating to the root directory of the project you'd like to use CheapskateUI in, and running the following command:

```npm install --save <../path/to/cheapskateui>```

Remove the brackets when you replace with the proper path to CheapskateUI on your local disk

## Future

If CheapskateUI is developed out enough to provide anything more than other UI kits that exist in the React ecosystem, it is our intention to package it and serve it through NPM.
